### Hi, I'm Nurjanah ðŸ‘‹

Informatics engineering fresh graduate with a passion for embracing technological challenges and innovation.  Iâ€™ve experience in student organizations, lecturer assistant, web dev intern, and participated in training programs as a data analyst and data engineer. 

Currently open to new job opportunities, I am excited about the possibility of applying my analytical skills and passion for data to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects. If you have any roles aligning with my aspirations in data analytics, I am keen to explore and bring my skills to a dynamic team.
